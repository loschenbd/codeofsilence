If you purchase a substitute item(s) to replace the item(s) you are returning, Code of Silence will pay return shipping on any item returned in re-sellable condition (unused, contained in original packaging, all tags attached and no dirt or animal hair etc. on the product). COS will only pay for the return shipping “once per transaction” however. If you wish to return an item that fits in the criteria mentioned above, please visit our return portal at ____________ .<\/p><p><strong>Return \/ Refund Processing Timeframe<br\/><\/strong>Expect to receive your refund of the item you are returning within 30 days of turn-over of your package to the return shipper. It can take less time and it is probable that you will receive your refund more quickly. Note that we have to allow for the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper, the time it takes us to process your return, and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request. <\/p><p><strong>Exclusions<br\/><\/strong>Items purchased from a retailer must be returned to the retailer they were purchased from within that retailer’s return or exchange time frame. <\/p><p><strong>Exchanges<br\/><\/strong>For clarity, please understand that while we do not offer “exchanges” in the traditional sense of the word, when you return an unused and unaltered item to us postage paid and you are re-ordering a new item of your choice, this transaction is very similar to an “exchange”. In basic form, you are rebuying a similar item while we verify the acceptability of your previously purchased item for restocking and fulfill the refund of the original transaction. Please note that this format allows you to receive a substitute item in a much quicker timeframe than a traditional “exchange” would provide.<\/p>"
