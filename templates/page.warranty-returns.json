If you purchase a substitute item(s) to replace the item(s) you are returning, Code of Silence will pay return shipping on any item returned in re-sellable condition (unused, contained in original packaging, all tags attached and no dirt or animal hair etc. on the product). COS will only pay for the return shipping “once per transaction” however. If you wish to return an item and it fits in the criteria mentioned above, please visit our return portal at :<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/codeofsilence-com.happyreturns.com\/\">http:\/\/codeofsilence-com.happyreturns.com<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Return \/ Refund Processing Timeframe:<br\/><\/strong>Expect to receive your refund of the item you are returning within 30 days of turn-over of your package to the return shipper. It can take less time and it is probable that you will receive your refund more quickly. Note that we have to allow for the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper, the time it takes us to process your return, and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request. <\/p><p><strong>Exclusions:<br\/><\/strong>Item(s) purchased <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">from a COS retail partner<\/span> must be returned to the retailer they were purchased from within that retailer’s return or exchange time frame. <\/p><p><strong>Exchanges:<\/strong><\/p><p>For clarity, please note that we gladly offer “exchanges” via the return portal referenced above under \"Returns\". Please note however that the turn-around time on receiving your new item(s) back in an “exchange” will be subject to the totality of the lead-time of the shipment back to us + our review of the item(s) you are returning + fulfillment of your new item(s) by our DC + the shipping time back to you on these new item(s). This process can often take up to 2-3 weeks of total lead-time. If timing is critical, we advise you to consider processing your original order as a “refund” (in the Return Portal referenced above under \"Returns\") and then simply \"re-ordering\" your newly targeted item(s) on our website as a new and separate purchase. If you choose to follow this process, please understand however that the return of funds on your original purchase will not be finalized until your original order is received at our DC, the returned order is processed and the information surrounding the transaction flows to and is processed by your provider. Our return portal referenced above can however manage either refunds or exchanges with equal efficiency.<\/p>"
