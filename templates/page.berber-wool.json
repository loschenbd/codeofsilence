        "text": "<p>This unique wool based “pile” fabric is a close “cousin” to our Berber-Wool™ but is engineered to be much “flatter” on the surface to provide less friction. This proprietary fabric took us years to perfect and while its less lofty than our Berber-Wool, it still presents the same dull\/natural looking exterior appearance. Our “jacquard” knitting technique ensures a uniform saturation of inks throughout the entire thickness of the fabric. This technique lowers the levels of unnatural synthetics such as inks on the exterior surface as compared to “printed” fabrics. The combination of the jacquard knit and the flatter face allows our Fleece-Wool to still appear very natural while reducing friction and minimizing retention of burrs.<\/p>",
