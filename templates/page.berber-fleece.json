        "title": "What is Berber Fleece?",
        "text": "<p>This unique wool based “pile” fabric is a close cousin to our Berber Wool ™ but is engineered to be much “flatter” on the surface to provide less friction when used in key areas within our garment designs and also, less attraction of burrs and debris across the board. This proprietary fabric took us years to perfect and while its<em>less lofty<\/em>than our Berber-Wool, it still presents the same dull\/ natural looking exterior appearance and is still a highly textured knitted (not woven) fabric. Our “jacquard” knitting technique ensures a uniform saturation of inks throughout the entire thickness of the fabric. Not only does this allow for less fading of the surface colors over time, it also lowers the levels of unnatural synthetics such as inks on the exterior surface as compared to “printed” fabrics. The combination of the jacquard knit and the flatter face allows our Fleece-Wool to still appear very natural while reducing friction and minimizing retention of burrs in areas such as the lower portions of our pant legs.<\/p>",
