In trying to “eliminate” moisture, a person must adhere to firm principles and a strict process. “Going in light” and layering at the tree or while in the stand as you cool down is paramount to avoid a layer of sweat on the body. At the same time, breathability is also hyper-critical. Don’t be fooled by claims that laminated products can “breathe”, and if you believe otherwise, put a laminated shell over your sleeping bag at zero degrees some night and see how that goes. The fact is laminates cannot breathe at even close to the level that you need them too in order to keep you warm while remaining stationary for extended periods of time. Code of Silence’s technologies effectively stop all wind velocities and trap in body heat while breathing substantially better than laminated products. This is the right combination of performance dynamics to keep you warm while stationary and the difference is undeniable.<\/p>"

High loft fabrics, synthetic insulations and natural products such as down work well at helping to manage warmth due almost entirely to their ability to trap and hold air. Our technologies and design techniques leverage this simple and proven principle to maximize the benefits of air while also keeping garment bulk to a minimum. This is a very hard combination to pull off but one that must be achieved to ensure warmth in the field while maintaining enough dexterity to effectively and comfortably hunt. Our “multiple layer” (up to 5 in the Coldfjall Series) design techniques in our cold weather products allow for “layering within a layer” and maximization of the above principles. <\/p><p>No more dreading leaving the truck, pack your gear and leave the rest up to us.<\/p>"

The knitting technique we use is called “jacquard” knitting and the fibers are dyed prior to knitting so the saturation of inks is consistent throughout the entire thickness of the fabric after knitting is complete. Not only does this allow for less fading of the surface colors over time, it also lowers the levels of unnatural synthetics (such as inks) on the exterior surface as compared to “printed” fabrics where approximately 100% of the inks used in the printing are applied after the fabric is woven or knit so the inks are therefore condensed in the top 20% of the fabric’s exterior face. This allows our Berber Wool to appear extremely natural and better “absorb” light and appear more natural compared to other commonly used hunting fabrications.<\/p>",
