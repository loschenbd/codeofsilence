As a hunter, it is very easy to consider sound levels created by your gear such as drawing a bow, shouldering a firearm, stand noise as critical. We couldn’t agree more with the importance of these dynamics but in general, deer utilize and depend greatly on their hearing to detect “abnormalities” in their environment. Eliminating sound within your approach to your stand, sound created while climbing into your stand, and sound created while on stand are just as important, if not more important as sound created while operating your weapon. Sound, and more importantly the elimination of it, translates to alerting or not alerting deer to your presence. Said differently, detecting unnatural noises is a matter of life and death in the woods. <strong>Silence is obviously more than key to hunting… it is essentia<\/strong>l. “Unnatural noise” is like scent, the goal should not be to “reduce it”, the goal should clearly be to eliminate it. The difference between noise elimination and noise reduction is game changing.

What happens next is the difference that dreams are made of. As we say, “when years turn into seconds” you need everything possible to be working to your advantage, period. Our S18 camo pattern, our fabric designs and our commitment to our “Neutral-LR” technology provide that advantage. We promise the level of going “unnoticed” on stand you will experience with Code of Silence clothing is beyond anything you have ever experienced in the field.<\/p>"
