Not only does this allow for less fading of the surface colors over time, it also lowers the levels of unnatural synthetics (such as inks) on the exterior surface as compared to “printed” fabrics where approximately 100% of the inks used in the printing are applied after the fabric is woven or knit so the inks are therefore condensed in the top 20% of the fabric’s exterior face.
